// IN this component we will change the state of a variable when a button is clicked 
// when the variable is clicked we will show Hello Aryan else we will hide it 
// Hence our variable can have two states true and false
// when state is true "Hello Aryan" will be shown else it wil be hidden

import {userState} from react;
